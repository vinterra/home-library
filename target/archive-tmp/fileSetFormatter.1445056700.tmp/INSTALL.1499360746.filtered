* Configure the Home Library
** How to specify the persistence dir.
	The Home Library need a persistence dir where to save the user home content and structure.
	To determine where to create the persistence dir the Home Library use the following algorithm:
	1. if an HOME_LIBRARY_PERSISTENCE_DIR environment variable is specified this is used a base dir, otherwise:
	2. if the system property catalina.base is set (generically set by tomcat), "catalina.base/webapps/usersArea" is used a base dir, 
		otherwise
	3. the system tmp directory is used a base dir. 
	Inside the base dir a home_library_persitence dir is created and used.


* Dependencies
	The home library require some library to be used:
