    <title>Oil spill near Gothenburg, Sweden</title>
    <caption>An oil spill is visible in this ERS-1 SAR image near Gothenburg, Sweden. An oil polluted sea surface appears black in low to moderate wind condition due to the dampening effect on smaller wind waves. 

Because of its form and sharp edges it is assumed to be an oil slick. The bright spots are ships, the distance between a ship and it's wake can be used to compute the speed of the ships.</caption>
